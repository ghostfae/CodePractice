Git - Version control system. Tracks changes in code, allows multiple developers to work on code simultaneously

null - nothing value. is a mistake because it causes bugs due to:
- null pointer exception (program tries to access null reference, leading to crashes)
- ambiguity (non-specific type)
- must be handled
- security risk (unintended access to memory)

string - collection of characters
immutable (any modification creates new strings) vs mutable (modification affects current string)


arrays - fixed collection of variables


runtime - execution of programs (C# runtime/Common Language Runtime/CLR)
- converts language to machine code
- manages memory
- ensures code runs safely
- handles exceptions
