Generic Notes -

- Hashset is a readonlycollection; doesnt care about order, guarantees uniqueness
- Why use properties instead of fields? -> 
- difference btw sequence and collection -> all collections are sequences, but not vice versa; collection is already stored memory

- LINQ is lazy because ....; opposite is eager (F# might use it?)

- hashset doesn't Order; ignores the order instead of imposes;

- yield return is better "for purity", but list iteration is faster

- lambda
///

- timespan is a 'long'

- what are stack traces?

- strategy design pattern

- delegate ?

ireadonlycollection - concrete object that is constructable; interface is a narrower view of object functionality (ireadonly collection), 
create array, pass as readonlycollection - cannot be edited  as an object

random access VS serial access - reflected in data types, in design
random - choose the position of elements yu want to access
serial - get it one by one

ienum - simplest collection - .tolist/array/creates a copy
then ireadonlycollection

tuples, anonymous objects: 
tuple deconstruction

design process - iterative/evolving design


///

Interfaces and base classes represent two different forms of relationships.

Inheritance (base classes) represent an "is-a" relationship.
	E.g. a dog or a cat "is-a" pet. 
This relationship always represents the (single) purpose of the class (in conjunction with the "single responsibility principle").

Interfaces, on the other hand, represent additional features of a class.
	"is" relationship, like in "Foo is disposable", hence the IDisposable interface in C#.
