Generic Notes -

- Hashset is a readonlycollection; doesnt care about order, guarantees uniqueness
- Why use properties instead of fields? -> 
- difference btw sequence and collection -> all collections are sequences, but not vice versa; collection is already stored memory

- LINQ is lazy because ....; opposite is eager (F# might use it?)

- hashset doesn't Order; ignores the order instead of imposes;

- yield return is better "for purity", but list iteration is faster

- lambda
