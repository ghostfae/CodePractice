	- adds formatting to plaintext text documents
	- is platform independent
eg:
	# Heading level 1
	## Heading level 2
	paragraphs are just plain text. use a blank line to seperate each line. don't tab in front, keep lines left-aligned.
	&nbsp; is used to tab.
	if you need to create a line break, end a line with two+ spaces and Enter.  
	**bold text** can be indicated like __this__.
	*italics* are like _this_.
	***both*** are ___this___.
	> This is a blockquote.
	>> You can even nest them.
